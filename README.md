# archaeoware

This is a web directory with links for Free/Open Source Software and resources for Archaeology and Heritage fields. This is an ongoing personal project and a concept proposal. I'm not sure if this project will ever go official. Meanwhile, code is here.

Archaeoware is a fork of CityBook https://github.com/codeforamerica/citybook

and was inspired by Open Archaeology Software & Resources https://zackbatist.github.io/open-archaeo/ and "Isaac's List of FOSS tools for academics... and what to use them for!" http://isaacullah.github.io/List-of-FOSS-tools-for-academics/
